Zoom Plugin
================================

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Mattermost/Zoom integration allows team members to initiate a Zoom meeting at the push of a button.  All participants in a channel can easily join the Zoom meeting and the shared link is updated when the meeting is over.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^
**Install via Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)**

1. Go to Main Menu > Plugin Marketplace in Mattermost
2. Search for "Zoom" or manually find the plugin from the list and click Install
3. After the plugin has downloaded and been installed, follow the instructions on Zoom Configuration4. After finishing the Zoom Configuration, follow the instructions on Mattermost Setup

**(Alternative) Install via Manual Upload**

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the latest plugin binary release and upload it to your server via System Console > Plugin Management. The binary releases on the page above, are the same as used by the Marketplace.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Zoom Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need to choose which authnetication method you want your users to connect their Zoom accounts
Zoom supports two authentication methods for your users to connect Mattermost and Zoom. Choose between using OAuth and JWT/Password based authentication:

**OAuth**

We are going to set the OAuth ClientID and OAuth Secret, generated by Zoom and used to create meetings and pull user data:
Go to https://marketplace.zoom.us/ and log in as an admin.

* Each user will need to connect their Zoom account with their Mattermost account before they can use the integration.  When they try to create a meeting for the first time, they will receive a message to connect their account, and will need to click "Approve" on a pop-up web page.
* Users can connect their MM/Zoom accounts even if their emails do not match.

**JWT/Password**

We are going to set the API Key and API Secret, generated by Zoom and used to create meetings and pull user data:
Go to https://marketplace.zoom.us and log in.

* Users don't have to connect their account to use the integration which makes it easy to get started.  
* Uses JWT to pass security tokens.  This may not be sufficiently secure for some customers.

Troubleshooting and Help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
This plugin contains both a server and web app portion.

* Use ``make dist`` to build distributions of the plugin that you can upload to a Mattermost server for testing.
* Use ``make check-style`` to check the style for the whole plugin.

Server
^^^^^^
Inside the ``/server`` directory, you will find the Go files that make up the server-side of the plugin. Within there, build the plugin like you would any other Go application.

Web App
^^^^^^
Inside the ``/webapp`` directory, you will find the JS and React files that make up the client-side of the plugin. Within there, modify files and components as necessary. Test your syntax by running npm run build.
